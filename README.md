# KdLoadingView
This is a circular loading view for android.
  
# Motivation

In default progress view, its hard to change drawable, color and animation. So this project was created to avoid these limitation and create custom easy customizable loading view.

# Getting started

## Installing 
To use this library simply import it by placing the following line under dependencies in your app module's build.gradle file

This library is posted in jCenter

#### Gradle
```
implementation 'in.unicodelabs.sorbh:kdloadignview:1.0.0'
```

#### Maven
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>in.unicodelabs.sorbh</groupId>
  <artifactId>kdloadingview</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

After Importing this library you can directly use this view in your view xml

    <in.unicodelabs.view.KdLoadingView
            android:id="@+id/kdLoadingView"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            app:tint="@color/colorPrimary"
            app:animation="@anim/rotate"
            app:anim_duration="2000"/>
            
  For now you can use 3 custom attributes

  * app:tint="@color/colorPrimary" - Color for loading view
  * app:animation="@anim/rotate" - Can set custom animaton drawable
  * app:anim_duration="2000" - Animation time in ms
